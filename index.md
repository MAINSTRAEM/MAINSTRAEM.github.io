Created by early career researchers to celebrate and support the rising stars within underrepresented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Topics, our first event will be hosted in January 2023 targeted at Early Career Researchers (e.g. PhD's and Post Docs) in Materials Science:

**Date:** Friday 13th January        
**Location:** The Henry Royce Institute, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK.

This full day event will combine intensive career skills workshops with creative networking activities as well as a carefully selected Q & A panel of experts with recent successes in their career paths. Priority registration will be given to historically marginalised groups whilst travel grants and funding for caring responsibilities are available upon application to aid accessibility.

This years participants will be invited to provide feedback to co-develop further events to ensure the relevance and usefulness of future activities. This January will be the launch of the event series but it’s success depends on it’s participants, helping them to not only work but to thrive in their research community. These events, in line with the UK Government’s R&D people and culture strategy visions, aim to address the diversity gap within STEM research and hence enhance the diversity of thought and innovation. 

This event is supported by Royce, L’Oreal and the Royal Society of Chemistry.
