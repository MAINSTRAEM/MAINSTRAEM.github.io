This full day event will combine intensive career skills workshops, creative networking activities and a carefully selected Q & A panel of experts with recent successes in their career paths. Priority registration will be given to historically marginalised groups, and funding for travel and/or caring responsibilities are available to aid accessibility. 

This years participants will be invited to provide feedback to co-develop further events to ensure the relevance and usefulness of future activities. Overrall, the events aim to support researchers to not only work but to thrive in their research community, to address the diversity gap within STEM research, and to hence enhance the diversity of thought and innovation.
