Created by early career researchers to celebrate and support the rising stars within underrepresented groups in solar research, the first of the MAINSTREAM events will be hosted in January 2023:

**Date:** Friday 13th January        
**Location:** Henry Royce Institute, The University of Manchester

This full day event will combine intensive career skills workshops with creative networking activities as well as a carefully selected Q & A panel of experts with recent successes in their career paths. Priority registration will be given to historically marginalised groups whilst travel grants and funding for caring responsibilities are available upon application to aid accessibility. In addition, up to 5 attendees will be selected as ‘Emerging Megastars’ and be awarded up to £1k in cash along with tailored training and mentorship opportunities.

This years participants will be invited to provide feedback to co-develop further events to ensure the relevance and usefulness of future activities. This January will be the launch of the MAINSTRAEM event series but it’s success depends on it’s participants, helping them to not only work but to thrive in the solar energy community. These events, in line with the UK Government’s R&D people and culture strategy visions, aim to address the diversity gap within STEM research and hence enhance the diversity of thought and innovations within solar energy. 

Supported by L’Oreal, IOP and the Royal Society of Chemistry, this interdisciplinary meeting welcomes the whole systems collaboration of solar engineers, material scientists, energy modellers, industrial researchers and all those surrounding the discipline of solar energy.
